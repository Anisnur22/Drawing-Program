This project is a Java Swing–based drawing application that allows users to create, edit, and compose images with various tools. It features a split workspace with two canvases:

-Left Canvas – for composing and manipulating images (e.g., flowers, animals, custom pictures).

-Right Canvas – for freehand drawing with pen, text, and rotation tools.

## Features

-Drawing Tools: Pen with adjustable size & color.

-Text Tool: Add movable text anywhere on the canvas.

-Image Tools: Insert flower, animal, or custom images.

-Canvas Controls: Rotate left/right, clear canvas, and compose images between canvases.

-File Operations: Save drawings as PNG and restrict image selection to specific folders.

-User Interaction: Drag & move creations, rotate selected images, adjust scaling within canvas boundaries.
